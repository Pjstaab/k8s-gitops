- [Kubernetes @Home Docs](https://k8s-at-home.com)

## üìã Requirements

In order to effectively utilize this repository, it is important to have the following tools set up in your environment.

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster
- [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/get-started/) installed
- [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) installed
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) installed

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Set up the necessary environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
export GITHUB_REPO=<your-repo>
export CLUSTER=<target-cluster>
```

2. Verify that your cluster satisfies the prerequisites:

```bash
flux check --pre
```

3. Run the bootstrap command to install Flux and deploy into the cluster:


```bash
task cluster CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-1
```

**Note:** *Many variables in the cluster depend on your specific configuration and should be modified accordingly. Be sure to review and adjust these variables as needed to match your environment and requirements.*
