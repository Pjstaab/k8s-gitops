# Rock Pi 4C

The following are pre-requisites to bootstrap kubernetes onto a cluster of Rock Pis

## Hardware

Since I decided to use an eMMC module rather than the typical microSD I needed to purchase either a eMMC to USB adapter or eMMC to microSD adapter. I purchased both and they work equally as fine except you can save some **$$$** if you choose to purchase the eMMC to microSD adapter.

Either can be purchased with the below links:
- [eMMC microSD adapter](https://ameridroid.com/products/emmc-adapter?_pos=2&_sid=dbd8c41c9&_ss=r)
- [eMMC USB3.0 adapter](https://ameridroid.com/products/usb-3-0-emmc-module-writer?_pos=8&_sid=dbd8c41c9&_ss=r)

## Instruction

When running `apt-get upgrade` you will get the following error:

```bash

**Fix**

Step 1: Install wget

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget
```

Step 2: Edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-radxa-com.list

```bash
deb http://apt.radxa.com/buster-stable/ buster main
deb http://apt.radxa.com/buster-testing/ buster main
```

Step 3: Get the public key

```bash
wget -O - apt.radxa.com/buster-testing/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
wget -O - apt.radxa.com/buster-stable/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
```
